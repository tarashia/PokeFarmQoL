- Use the 'n' key on the keyboard to select an egg instead of clicking on it
### Sanctioned Script
- Does not currently have the ability to search for Not Fully Evolved (NFE) or Ready to Evolve (RTE) pokemon. This may be updated later, but at the moment, it is a feature that has proven buggy for many users, and so was left out of the Sanctioned version.
### Tampermonkey Script
- Additional search parameters:
  - RTE pokemon
  - NFE pokemon
## Wishforge Page (/forge)
- Condense the list of Crafted Badges into a table

# Past Suggestions/Issues
- **Farm Page** - Easy Evolution doesn't work when the list is sorted - This was not fixed, because it is impossible to implement given the current design of the sorted lists without copying code from pokefarm.
- **Shelter** - Add nature/berry selector - This feature was not implemented, because it would 1) cause the shelter page to be extremely slow, 2) requires additional information not readily available on the shelter page, and 3) (may) break the one-click rule.
- **Shelter** - Highlight pokemon that are ready to evolve (by item) - This feature was not implemented, because it would require loading information from a user's inventory
